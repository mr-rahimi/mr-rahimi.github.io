# I AM ...

Software Engineer since 2009 with experiences building and maintaining software applications. Effectively working in both project and product teams. solid expertise in C#, .NET and the .NET ecosystem. I consider myself results-oriented, minimalist, and detail-oriented. I have received positive feedback from my coleagues regarding my knowledge-sharing, foresight in decision-making, and critical thinking.

# Me and Software Engineering

Software engineering for me transcends simply earning a living (though it's certainly been a rewarding aspect). It's about viewing the world through a logical lens, understanding how events interconnect, and ultimately predicting or influencing them. My true passion lies in harnessing this logical approach to improve specific aspects of the world, not everything. The various tools of software engineering are simply the means to this end.

Unbiased by specific tools, I prioritize understanding the problem before reaching for a solution. However, I do hold a particular interest in C# and the .NET stack Although I have good knowledge of JavaScript and Python. If a problem aligns well with C#'s capabilities, it will undoubtedly be my preferred choice.

Beyond specific languages, I'm fascinated by Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and its ability to create computer-based simulations that mirror real-world contexts. Additionally, system design excites me – the challenge of crafting software that seamlessly integrates into the real world while maintaining optimal performance under diverse conditions.
